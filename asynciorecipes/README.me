asyncio Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach

Coroutines can be thought of as functions you can “pause” at stages explicitly marked with some sort of syntactical element. The coroutine’s state is tracked via a task object, instantiated by the respective event loop. The event loop keeps track of which task is currently running and delegates CPU time from idling coroutines to a pending one.
